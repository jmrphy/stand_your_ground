But Kelly and other neighbors including some whites gradually drew away from Madak who boasted about always carrying a gun (he did have a concealed weapons permit) and developed a reputation as a neighborhood bully and vigilante who didn't like blacks. On the night of the shooting Kelly called the sheriff's office saying that Madak had a gun and was threatening to flatten the whole neighborhood. A deputy came out saw that Madak appeared to be intoxicated and told him to go back into his house. But after the deputy left Madak and Kelly got into a fistfight that culminated in both of them shooting with Madak firing at least 12 shots including two that hit Kelly and Kelly firing twice hitting Madak once.,"The outcome: Madak who also aimed his gun at two other people was charged with three counts; Kelly with one.

Glen Rich tried to retrieve his car after it had been taken from a legal parking spot at the Sugar Shack strip club. He and his brothers accelerated their car toward Rivera and Rivera said he fired in self-defense. But evidence showed the gun was fired as the car passed by.

Prosecutors had been ready to challenge the ""stand your ground"" defense because a person committing a crime (as they said Rivera was doing with his illegal towing business) is not eligible under that statute. A jury found Rivera guilty of a lesser charge manslaughter in March 2012. The judge had refused to grant immunity prior to the trial and the 2nd DCA upheld that decision on appeal.

Leon County Judge Josefina Tomayo denied Jackson's stand your ground motion. In Oct. 2011 a jury found Jackson not guilty of murder but convicted him on gun possession charges.

However he became a state's witness against Jackson and pleaded to the lesser charges of felon with a gun and was sentenced to 8 years in prison according to his attorney Chuck Hobbs. Despite the judge's ruling Hobbs says ""For a defense attorney it (stand your ground) is an excellent tool.

They engaged some FSU fans and in what started out as friendly banter about their teams progressed to trading insults and escalated into a physical altercation. Witnesses' accounts differ wildly and the parties involved admitted to drinking before the incident. Some thought ATF agent Javier Ribas was being strangled by FSU fan Derek Smith while others said they were just involved in a shoving match. Ribas' friend federal immigration agent Edward Mederos intervened brandishing his government issued knife and pulled him from danger. Mederos then went back and continued to fight with an unarmed Smith. It ended when Mederos stabbed Smith in the palm of his hand. Campus police arrived and arrested Mederos and charged him with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.,The outcome: A judge denied Mederos immunity from prosecution at a Stand Your Ground hearing. The First District Court rejected his appeal in August of 2012. Mederos claimed he was acting in self-defense and protecting his friend.

Steven Stearns began pounding on Pupello's car window and dragging him from his car; Stearns' friend Shane McLaughlin was behind him. As Pupello was being dragged from the car he pulled a pistol from his waistband and wounded the two men. He claimed McLaughlin had a gun and he was in fear for his life; police never found any evidence McLaughlin was armed. Pupello ran off after the shooting and his friend drove off in his car. Stearns was left bleeding in the driveway; McLaughlin got back into the Cadillac and was driven by his friend to Tampa General Hospital. Both men survived.
