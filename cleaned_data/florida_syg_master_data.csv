Schecter then continued with his jog after yelling at the homeowner that she should keep her dog secured. Two witnesses however supported the story told by the dog's owner Norma Valdez. Valdez said she was mowing her lawn when her dog ran out to the jogger and began sniffing his dog. When the two dogs began to fight she said Schecter hit her dog repeatedly even after it was on the ground. He then told Valdez a Hispanic that she did not belong in this country and that she did not obey the laws.

Most of the blood on Orr's body was near his armpit suggesting he had the victim in a headlock as he repeatedly stabbed. The violent attack was preceded by an argument and by Joseph ramming his bicycle into Orr as he walked through the Lake Park neighborhood.
