abstract = {Though the prospective relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and human rights has long been a prominent issue within the global political economy, the linkage is empirically underdeveloped. Rather, the conventional wisdom that FDI and respect for human rights are inherently contradictory has persisted. Instead, we posit that respect for human rights may encourage FDI. To examine this issue, we assess the direct effects of human rights upon FDI as well as the extent to which human rights indirectly affects FDI through its impact upon human capital. Using a system of simultaneous equations, we find respect for human rights to have a positive impact upon FDI.},

External and domestic influences on the government's decision to abandon its broadcasting monopoly are examined. The politics of broadcast deregulation and reform are analyzed. Special attention is devoted to processes leading to the introduction of commercial broadcasting and a national television service. It is argued that for media to play democracy-nurturing roles, workers must be empowered with adequate resources, training, experience, and professionalism.},

We propose distinguishing between the use of the Internet as a tool by those seeking to bring about change from below, and the Internet{\textquoteright}s role as a space where collective dissent can be articulated. We argue that it is important to go beyond three sets of polemics. First, we argue for transcending the debate between utopian and dystopian perspectives on the role of the Internet in political change. Second, we propose a shift away from perspectives that isolate the Internet from other media by examining the powerful synergy between social media and satellite broadcasters during the January 25 uprising. And finally, we call for an understanding of the dialectical relationship between online and offline political action.},

The findings verify that the dominant type of Granger-causality is bidirectional. In instances that we found one-way causality, the pattern is not homogenous: Our analyses show that one-way causality generally runs from income to health in low- and middle-income countries whereas the reverse holds for high-income countries. Accordingly, care must be paid in defining the dependent and independent variables when specifying the determinants of health care expenditure.},

abstract = {Transition path sampling has been established as a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of rare events. The trajectory generation moves of this Monte Carlo procedure, shooting moves and shifting modes, were developed primarily for rate constant calculations, although this method has been more extensively used to study the dynamics of reactive processes. We have devised and implemented three alternative trajectory generation moves for use with transition path sampling. The centering-shooting move incorporates a shifting move into a shooting move, which centers the transition period in the middle of the trajectory, eliminating the need for shifting moves and generating an ensemble where the transition event consistently occurs near the middle of the trajectory. We have also developed varied-perturbation size shooting moves, wherein smaller perturbations are made if the shooting point is far from the transition event. The trajectories generated using these moves decorrelate significantly faster than with conventional, constant sized perturbations. This results in an increase in the statistical efficiency by a factor of 2.5-5 when compared to the conventional shooting algorithm. On the other hand, the new algorithm breaks detailed balance and introduces a small bias in the transition time distribution. We have developed a modification of this varied-perturbation size shooting algorithm that preserves detailed balance, albeit at the cost of decreased sampling efficiency. Both varied-perturbation size shooting algorithms are found to have improved sampling efficiency when compared to the original constant perturbation size shooting algorithm.},

Saskia Sassen is an internationally recognized expert on globalization whose writings have appeared in journals and magazines worldwide. Now available in paperback, Globalization and Its Discontents is a collection of Sassen's essays dealing with topics such as the "global city," gender and migration (reconceived as the globalization of labor), information technology, and the new dynamics of inequality. Sassen brings together cultural and literary studies, feminist theory, political economics, sociology, and political science, showing how vast the chasm between metropolitan business centers and low-income inner cities has become. Incisive and original, she takes on common political, cultural, and economic misconceptions of globalization and offers a thoughtful, provocative new look at our increasingly global society.},

A pooled time series/cross-sectional analysis of eighteen countries from 1965 to 1986 provides strong evidence that collective veto points tend to buoy welfare expenditures and lead to higher degrees of decommodification, while the reverse is true of competitive veto points. Consensual political institutions also affect welfare expenditures and decommodification positively, while majoritarian systems tend to depress them. Thus, competitive veto points tightly restrain governmental action, while collective veto points enable government.},

We hypothesize that the individual's ability and desire to exercise selective exposure is a key factor in determining whether a given source produces exposure to dissimilar views. Although a lack of diverse perspectives is a common complaint against American news media, we find that individuals are exposed to far more dissimilar political views via news media than through interpersonal political discussants. The media advantage is rooted in the relative difficulty of selectively exposing oneself to those sources of information, as well as the lesser desire to do so, given the impersonal nature of mass media.},

Hypotheses: Lichbach (1987) hypothesizes that dissidents will substitute violent protest for nonviolent protest behavior (and vice versa) when confronted with repression. Gupta, Singh, and Sprague (1993) put forth a contextual argument: repression spurs violence in democracies, but high levels of repression are effective in authoritarian regimes. Rasler (1996) contends that timing matters: repression is effective in the short run, but spurs protest in the long run. Methods: Sequential tests of events data are used to test the hypotheses. Results: Lichbach's theory is supported by the evidence, but neither Gupta, Singh, and Sprague's nor Rasler's theories receives support.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED:ROCR is a package for evaluating and visualizing the performance of scoring classifiers in the statistical language R. It features over 25 performance measures that can be freely combined to create two-dimensional performance curves. Standard methods for investigating trade-offs between specific performance measures are available within a uniform framework, including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) graphs, precision/recall plots, lift charts and cost curves. ROCR integrates tightly with R's powerful graphics capabilities, thus allowing for highly adjustable plots. Being equipped with only three commands and reasonable default values for optional parameters, ROCR combines flexibility with ease of usage. AVAILABILITY:http://rocr.bioinf.mpi-sb.mpg.de.

abstract = {This paper considers estimation and testing of vector autoregression coefficients in panel data, and applies the techniques to analyze the dynamic relationships between wages and hours worked in two samples of American males. The model allows for nonstationary individual effects, and is estimated by applying instrumental variables to the quasi-differenced autoregressive equations. Particular attention is paid to specifying lag lengths, forming convenient test statistics, and testing for the presence of measurement error. The empirical results suggest the absence of lagged hours in the wage of forecasting equation. Our results also show that lagged hours is important in the hours equation, which is consistent with alternatives to the simple labor supply model that allow for costly hours adjustment or preferences that are not time separable.},

We argue that Mexico's liberalization of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in the 1990s provides a natural experiment to test how FDI affects income inequality in a middle-income country. We use an instrumental variables approach as our identification strategy to mitigate problems of endogeneity and omitted variable bias. In an empirical test of the determinants of changes in income inequality from 1990 to 2000, we find that increased FDI inflows are associated with a decrease in income inequality within Mexico's thirty-two states.},

In contrast, a political explanation of welfare state development in Chile and Mexico emphasizes the persistent differences in models of social provision. Mexico has used means-tested consumption subsidies and measures to correct market failures affecting the poor, while Chile used an asset redistribution and universal entitlement approach before 1973 and quasi-universal but modest consumption subsidies after 1990. Three political variables-competitiveness of the party system, organization of the poor, and alliance patterns-account for differences in welfare regime outcomes and are framed by the structural and ideational constraints of the prevailing developmental model.},

abstract = {I address the functioning of the U.S. governing system by analyzing distributional outcomes from 1947 to 2000. The key question is whether public policy influences distributional outcomes. The macropolitics model and power resource theory suggest that left policies should equalize the distribution of income. I utilize single equation error correction models to assess the impact of policy on income inequality through two mechanisms-market conditioning and redistribution. Since nearly every government action influences markets in some way, I examine policy in the aggregate rather than focusing only on policies explicitly designed to redistribute income. The analysis indicates that policy influences inequality through both mechanisms, with left policy producing more equality. The results are consistent with power resource theory and strongly support the macropolitics model. Furthermore, I find that market conditioning is as important as, and works in tandem with, explicit redistribution.},

Demonstrations in both countries were facilitated in some part by the online social media and related information and communications technologies that impacted the flow of information. The manner in which the information and communication technologies were employed suggests that the uprisings were a form of social information warfare. To provide an alternative understanding of the role of technology and information in the events that led to the resignations of the Tunisian and Egyptian presidents, these uprisings are analyzed using the Information Warfare Lifecycle Model.},

abstract = {International relations theorists tend to think in terms of continuous processes. Yet we observe only discrete events, such as wars or alliances, and summarize them in terms of the frequency of occurrence. As such, most empirical analyses in international relations are based on event count variables. Unfortunately, analysts have generally relied on statistical techniques that were designed for continuous data. This mismatch between theory and method has caused bias, inefficiency, and numerous inconsistencies in both theoretical arguments and empirical findings throughout the literature. This article develops a much more powerful approach to modeling and statistical analysis based explicitly on estimating continuous processes from observed event counts. To demonstrate this class of models, I present several new statistical techniques developed for and applied to different areas of international relations. These include the influence of international alliances on the outbreak of war, the contagious process of multilateral economic sanctions, and reciprocity in superpower conflict. I also show how one can extract considerably more information from existing data and relate substantive theory to empirical analyses more explicitly with this approach.},

Saskia Sassen is an internationally recognized expert on globalization whose writings have appeared in journals and magazines worldwide. Now available in paperback, Globalization and Its Discontents is a collection of Sassen's essays dealing with topics such as the "global city," gender and migration (reconceived as the globalization of labor), information technology, and the new dynamics of inequality. Sassen brings together cultural and literary studies, feminist theory, political economics, sociology, and political science, showing how vast the chasm between metropolitan business centers and low-income inner cities has become. Incisive and original, she takes on common political, cultural, and economic misconceptions of globalization and offers a thoughtful, provocative new look at our increasingly global society.},

The other side argues that ideological thinking is not beyond the public. The way forward for research in political ideology does not lie in rehashing this debate but in moving forward in two new areas of work. The first considers the role that values and principles play in determining the political and ideological thinking of individuals. The second questions the current conception and measurement standards of political ideology. This research argues that ideology among the American mass public is formed by positions along two related but separate dimensions. In this article, we summarize the major arguments of and criticisms of current ideology research. Then we discuss recent research on principles and values and the measurement of ideology.

abstract = {Foreign direct investment (FDI) is an important element of the global economy and a central component of economic development strategies of both developed and developing countries. Numerous scholars theorize that the economic benefits of attracting multinational corporations come at tremendous political costs, arguing that democratic political systems attract lower levels of international investment than their authoritarian counterparts. Using both cross-sectional and time-series cross-sectional tests of the determinants of FDI for more than 100 countries, I generate results that are inconsistent with these dire predictions. Democratic political systems attract higher levels of FDI inflows both across countries and within countries over time. Democratic countries are predicted to attract as much as 70 percent more FDI than their authoritarian counterparts. In a final empirical test, I examine how democratic institutions affect country credibility by empirically analyzing the link between democracy and sovereign debt risk for about eighty countries from 1980 to 1998. These empirical tests challenge the conventional wisdom on the preferences of multinationals for authoritarian regimes.},

However, it happens at the most politically sensitive times and has widespread{\textemdash}if not global{\textemdash}consequences for political, economic and cultural life. When do states disconnect their digital networks, and why? To answer this question, the authors build an event history database of incidents in which a regime went beyond mere censorship of particular websites or users. The authors draw from multiple sources, including major news media, specialized news services, and international experts, to construct an event log database of 566 incidents. This rich, original dataset allows for a nuanced analysis of the conditions for state action, and the authors offer some assessment of the effect of such desperate action.

Gupta, Singh, and Sprague (1993) put forth a contextual argument: repression spurs violence in democracies, but high levels of repression are effective in authoritarian regimes. Rasler (1996) contends that timing matters: repression is effective in the short run, but spurs protest in the long run. Methods: Sequential tests of events data are used to test the hypotheses. Results: Lichbach's theory is supported by the evidence, but neither Gupta, Singh, and Sprague's nor Rasler's theories receives support.},

abstract = {No other figure embodies revolutionary politics and radical chic quite like Ulrike Meinhof, who formed, with Andreas Baader and Gudrun Ensslin, the Red Army Faction (RAF), also known as the Baader{\textendash}Meinhof Gang, notorious for its bombings and kidnappings of the wealthy in the 1970s. But in the years leading up to her leap into the fray, Meinhof was known throughout Europe as a respected journalist, who informed and entertained her loyal readers with monthly magazine columns. What impels someone to abandon middle-class privilege for the sake of revolution? In the 1960s, Meinhof began to see the world in increasingly stark terms: the United States was emerging as an unstoppable superpower, massacring a tiny country overseas despite increasingly popular dissent at home; and Germany appeared to be run by former Nazis. Never before translated into English, Meinhof's writings show a woman increasingly engaged in the major political events and social currents of her time. In her introduction, Karin Bauer tells Meinhof's mesmerizing life story and her political coming-of-age; Nobel Prize{\textendash}winning author Elfriede Jelinek provides a thoughtful reflection on Meinhof's tragic failure to be heard; and Meinhof {\textquoteright}s daughter{\textemdash}a relentless critic of her mother and of the Left{\textemdash}contributes an afterword that shows how Meinhof's ghost still haunts us today.},

abstract = {Public opinion research has sometimes been neglectful of both the political content of its data and the extent to which it could vitalize the theory of democratic politics. In this, his Presidential Address before the seventh annual convention of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, Bernard Berelson restates the fundamental requirements of a democratic politic and points out how opinion research can help a democracy to know itself, evaluate its achievements, and bring its practices more nearly in accord with its own fundamental ideals. Mr. Berelson's interest in this topic has developed out of, and is expressed in, the Elmira study of opinion formation during the Presidential campaign of 1948. In the preparation of this paper, he has benefited from discussions with Edward Shils, his former colleague at the University of Chicago, and from his reading of Mr. Shils' manuscript on Consensus and Liberty: The Social and Psychological Conditions of Political Democracy.},

It considers the association between the expansion of shrimp farms and enhanced social conflict and the emergence of local resistance movements of the poor. It describes the globalization of shrimp mariculture, discusses its repercussions in Asia and Latin America, and explores its recent expansion in Central America. It reveals a number of factors that affect rural livelihoods, impinge on small farmers, and hurt the rural poor, and suggests that the industry may be intensifying the social and ecological crises associated with commodities promoted earlier. It raises serious concerns regarding equity, increased marginalization of the rural poor, and the further destruction of Central America's biophysical environment and natural resource base. Finally, it proposes changes in policy necessary to bring about more equitable and susta...},

abstract = {We present a new way of extracting policy positions from political texts that treats texts not as discourses to be understood and interpreted but rather, as data in the form of words. We compare this approach to previous methods of text analysis and use it to replicate published estimates of the policy positions of political parties in Britain and Ireland, on both economic and social policy dimensions. We "export" the method to a non-English-language environment, analyzing the policy positions of German parties, including the PDS as it entered the former West German party system. Finally, we extend its application beyond the analysis of party manifestos, to the estimation of political positions from legislative speeches. Our "language-blind" word scoring technique successfully replicates published policy estimates without the substantial costs of time and labor that these require. Furthermore, unlike in any previous method for extracting policy positions from political texts, we provide uncertainty measures for our estimates, allowing analysts to make informed judgments of the extent to which differences between two estimated policy positions can be viewed as significant or merely as products of measurement error.},

All forms of information technology were until recently either heavily regulated by the Tunisian state or were owned by individuals with close links to then-President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. This analysis looks at regulatory regimes across three media and communications technologies during the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia{\textemdash}Internet, television and mobile phones{\textemdash}and shows that the regulatory regimes of media and communications technologies co-evolved with the protests. As expression about public protests became increasingly pervasive within these media, efforts to control them became increasingly restrictive. Thus changes in the media and communications landscape are discussed in the context of the co-evolution of regulatory regimes.},

abstract = {Before there was money, there was debt Every economics textbook says the same thing: Money was invented to replace onerous and complicated barter systems{\textemdash}to relieve ancient people from having to haul their goods to market. The problem with this version of history? There{\textquoteright}s not a shred of evidence to support it. Here anthropologist David Graeber presents a stunning reversal of conventional wisdom. He shows that for more than 5,000 years, since the beginnings of the first agrarian empires, humans have used elaborate credit systems to buy and sell goods{\textemdash}that is, long before the invention of coins or cash. It is in this era, Graeber argues, that we also first encounter a society divided into debtors and creditors. Graeber shows that arguments about debt and debt forgiveness have been at the center of political debates from Italy to China, as well as sparking innumerable insurrections. He also brilliantly demonstrates that the language of the ancient works of law and religion (words like {\textquotedblleft}guilt,{\textquotedblright} {\textquotedblleft}sin,{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}redemption{\textquotedblright}) derive in large part from ancient debates about debt, and shape even our most basic ideas of right and wrong. We are still fighting these battles today without knowing it. Debt: The First 5,000 Years is a fascinating chronicle of this little known history{\textemdash}as well as how it has defined human history, and what it means for the credit crisis of the present day and the future of our economy.

This argument helps in understanding how cultural practices such as mass ceremonies constitute power, how talking in inward-facing circles helps coordination, and why `social' goods tend to be advertised on popular and expensive television shows. The main conclusion is that cultural practices, usually understood in terms of `meaning' or `content', must also be understood in terms of `publicity', or more precisely common knowledge generation.},

abstract = {Much of the academic finance literature has been devoted to theoretical principles concerning portfolio design, the efficient market and strategic asset allocation. Similarly, industry organization studies have been concerned with the fundamentals of firm structure, entry and exit from the industry, and spatial and industrial concentration. But finance is also a never-ending series of daily stories, issuing from the pink pages of respectable broadsheet newspapers and other print media and increasingly dominated by the cacophony of voices, images and events broadcast by television and on-line real-time data services. Finance has become a media event, with its breathless reporters and star anchorpersons more often approximating Entertainment Tonight or even (at the limit) MTV. This fact of financial life could be treated as ephemeral and of minor significance (compared to the {\textquoteleft}real{\textquoteright} facts of economic principles). But financial institutions take it very seriously indeed. How and why this is the case are the ...},

abstract = {Given the increasingly polarized nature of American politics, renewed attention has been focused on the ideological nature of the mass public. Using Bayesian Item Response Theory (IRT), we examine the contemporary contours of policy attitudes as they relate to ideological identity and we consider the implications for the way scholars conceptualize, measure, and use political ideology in empirical research. Although political rhetoric today is clearly organized by a single ideological dimension, we find that the belief systems of the mass public remain multidimensional, with many in the electorate holding liberal preferences on one dimension and conservative preferences on another. These crosspressured individuals tend to self-identify as moderate (or say "Don't Know") in response to the standard liberal-conservative scale, thereby jeopardizing the validity of this commonly used measure. Our analysis further shows that failing to account for the multidimensional nature of ideological preferences can produce inaccurate predictions about the voting behavior of the American public.},

In this, his Presidential Address before the seventh annual convention of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, Bernard Berelson restates the fundamental requirements of a democratic politic and points out how opinion research can help a democracy to know itself, evaluate its achievements, and bring its practices more nearly in accord with its own fundamental ideals. Mr. Berelson's interest in this topic has developed out of, and is expressed in, the Elmira study of opinion formation during the Presidential campaign of 1948. In the preparation of this paper, he has benefited from discussions with Edward Shils, his former colleague at the University of Chicago, and from his reading of Mr. Shils' manuscript on Consensus and Liberty: The Social and Psychological Conditions of Political Democracy.},

The Project consists of three data sets documenting media use by protesters, by coordinators, and by transnational audiences. Preliminary descriptive analysis of the data suggests that social media use was not dominant in demonstrations, but may have played an important role in connecting and motivating protesters. Metrics for media use by protesters indicate a strong presence of activities and characteristics commonly associated with communication in protests to social media and social media users. These metrics, along with preliminary data on coordinator strategies and preliminary analysis of the {\#}jan25 tweet set, suggest an important but complex role played by social media in the Egyptian revolution of 2011. The data and preliminary analysis are presented here, together with a number of research questions for further study.},

A pooled time series/cross-sectional analysis of eighteen countries from 1965 to 1986 provides strong evidence that collective veto points tend to buoy welfare expenditures and lead to higher degrees of decommodification, while the reverse is true of competitive veto points. Consensual political institutions also affect welfare expenditures and decommodification positively, while majoritarian systems tend to depress them. Thus, competitive veto points tightly restrain governmental action, while collective veto points enable government.},

While there is much hype about success stories, the bitter truth that presents itself is that the majority of e-government projects in developing countries fail. After an introduction to Ciborra's (2005) view on e-government, this paper proceeds to use Heeks' (2003) 'archetypes of failure', which are brought about by gaps between the design of the technology itself and reality of the context, to classify some of the current literature. This classification provides a brief overview of themes manifested within this body of knowledge, serving as a useful background for practitioners and implementers of e-government in developing countries.},

Demonstrations in both countries were facilitated in some part by the online social media and related information and communications technologies that impacted the flow of information. The manner in which the information and communication technologies were employed suggests that the uprisings were a form of social information warfare. To provide an alternative understanding of the role of technology and information in the events that led to the resignations of the Tunisian and Egyptian presidents, these uprisings are analyzed using the Information Warfare Lifecycle Model.},

We impose intellectual discipline by requiring that actors behave rationally using available information and that basic economic relationschips such as budget constraints be accounted for. We attempt to integrate two approaches, one based on dynamic games played by interest groups, with one that focus on limited information and the dynamic of learning. We describe the "starting point" as the set of "old" policies and we attempt to explain the dynamics (political, economic and informational) that lead to reform (section II). We analyze strategies for reformers subject to political constraints (section III). We evaluate the aggregate and distributional costs of reforms, emphasizing the importance of looking at the right counterfactuals (section IV). We conclude by pointing to the challenges ahead: the second-stage institutional reforms necessary to take off from underdevelopment.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

abstract = {Transition path sampling has been established as a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of rare events. The trajectory generation moves of this Monte Carlo procedure, shooting moves and shifting modes, were developed primarily for rate constant calculations, although this method has been more extensively used to study the dynamics of reactive processes. We have devised and implemented three alternative trajectory generation moves for use with transition path sampling. The centering-shooting move incorporates a shifting move into a shooting move, which centers the transition period in the middle of the trajectory, eliminating the need for shifting moves and generating an ensemble where the transition event consistently occurs near the middle of the trajectory. We have also developed varied-perturbation size shooting moves, wherein smaller perturbations are made if the shooting point is far from the transition event. The trajectories generated using these moves decorrelate significantly faster than with conventional, constant sized perturbations. This results in an increase in the statistical efficiency by a factor of 2.5-5 when compared to the conventional shooting algorithm. On the other hand, the new algorithm breaks detailed balance and introduces a small bias in the transition time distribution. We have developed a modification of this varied-perturbation size shooting algorithm that preserves detailed balance, albeit at the cost of decreased sampling efficiency. Both varied-perturbation size shooting algorithms are found to have improved sampling efficiency when compared to the original constant perturbation size shooting algorithm.},

We propose distinguishing between the use of the Internet as a tool by those seeking to bring about change from below, and the Internet{\textquoteright}s role as a space where collective dissent can be articulated. We argue that it is important to go beyond three sets of polemics. First, we argue for transcending the debate between utopian and dystopian perspectives on the role of the Internet in political change. Second, we propose a shift away from perspectives that isolate the Internet from other media by examining the powerful synergy between social media and satellite broadcasters during the January 25 uprising. And finally, we call for an understanding of the dialectical relationship between online and offline political action.},

Rather, they actively try to shape or manage citizens' perceptions of events (particularly those involving negative outcomes) through explanations or accounts.

The distinction between excuses and justifications provides a valuable conceptual framework for understanding the impact of political accounts on a variety of judgments and psychological processes. I examine satisfaction with various excuses and justifications and their impact on subsequent evaluations of the official.},

Castells (2009) contended that social networking sites offer a form of mass communication of the self wherein individuals can acquire a new creative autonomy. Stiegler (2009) and the Ars Industrialis collective believe that the processes of individuation, and of speaking out, hold the key to empowerment, agency, and resistance. In this article the authors offer a critical reflection on the logic of mediated participation promoted by social media through a consideration of the differences between individual and collective forms of mediated political participation. Drawing on ethnographic research on alternative media within the Trade Union Movement in Britain and recent research on the political culture of social networking sites, the authors argue that far from being empowering, the logic of self-centered participation promoted by social media can represent a threat fo...},

abstract = {In this article we explore the relationship between the investments of multinational corporations (foreign direct investment) and income inequality in Mexico. We argue that Mexico's liberalization of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in the 1990s provides a natural experiment to test how FDI affects income inequality in a middle-income country. We use an instrumental variables approach as our identification strategy to mitigate problems of endogeneity and omitted variable bias. In an empirical test of the determinants of changes in income inequality from 1990 to 2000, we find that increased FDI inflows are associated with a decrease in income inequality within Mexico's thirty-two states.},

External and domestic influences on the government's decision to abandon its broadcasting monopoly are examined. The politics of broadcast deregulation and reform are analyzed. Special attention is devoted to processes leading to the introduction of commercial broadcasting and a national television service. It is argued that for media to play democracy-nurturing roles, workers must be empowered with adequate resources, training, experience, and professionalism.},

abstract = {This paper provides an insight to the trends that exist within academic writing in the much talked about area of e-government, and the potential they hold for developing countries. While there is much hype about success stories, the bitter truth that presents itself is that the majority of e-government projects in developing countries fail. After an introduction to Ciborra's (2005) view on e-government, this paper proceeds to use Heeks' (2003) 'archetypes of failure', which are brought about by gaps between the design of the technology itself and reality of the context, to classify some of the current literature. This classification provides a brief overview of themes manifested within this body of knowledge, serving as a useful background for practitioners and implementers of e-government in developing countries.},

It also interrogates how change elsewhere in the region may emerge in very different ways than has been the case in Tunisia and Egypt.},

We differentiate between these user types and analyze patterns of sourcing and routing information among them. We describe the symbiotic relationship between media outlets and individuals and the distinct roles particular user types appear to play. Using this analysis, we discuss how Twitter plays a key role in amplifying and spreading timely information across the globe.},

abstract = {The Tahrir Data Project gathers empirical data on media use during the Egyptian revolution of January and February 2011. The Project consists of three data sets documenting media use by protesters, by coordinators, and by transnational audiences. Preliminary descriptive analysis of the data suggests that social media use was not dominant in demonstrations, but may have played an important role in connecting and motivating protesters. Metrics for media use by protesters indicate a strong presence of activities and characteristics commonly associated with communication in protests to social media and social media users. These metrics, along with preliminary data on coordinator strategies and preliminary analysis of the {\#}jan25 tweet set, suggest an important but complex role played by social media in the Egyptian revolution of 2011. The data and preliminary analysis are presented here, together with a number of research questions for further study.},

We hypothesize that the individual's ability and desire to exercise selective exposure is a key factor in determining whether a given source produces exposure to dissimilar views. Although a lack of diverse perspectives is a common complaint against American news media, we find that individuals are exposed to far more dissimilar political views via news media than through interpersonal political discussants. The media advantage is rooted in the relative difficulty of selectively exposing oneself to those sources of information, as well as the lesser desire to do so, given the impersonal nature of mass media.},

It argues that social media played an instrumental role in the success of the anti-government protests that led to the resignation of the country{\textquoteright}s dictatorial leader, and calls for further examination of the proposed incorporation of social media as an important resource for collective action and the organization of contemporary social movements.},

The problem of communicating their results is formidable, however, because many other scholars are unfamiliar with this type of analysis. The aim of this paper is to draw a conceptual map of the method and clarify the technical paraphernalia so that consumers of factor studies can interpret them usefully. Topics include the relationship of factor analysis to scientific method; the factor model; interpreting factor tables; and factor rotation. Sample international data are used as illustrations, and the paper includes a bibliography of factor analysis in conflict and international relations.},

abstract = {Ideology has re-emerged as an important topic of inquiry among social, personality, and political psychologists. In this review, we examine recent theory and research concerning the structure, contents, and functions of ideological belief systems. We begin by defining the construct and placing it in historical and philosophical context. We then examine different perspectives on how many (and what types of) dimensions individuals use to organize their political opinions. We investigate (a) how and to what extent individuals acquire the discursive contents associated with various ideologies, and (b) the social-psychological functions that these ideologies serve for those who adopt them. Our review highlights {\textquotedblleft}elective affinities{\textquotedblright} between situational and dispositional needs of individuals and groups and the structure and contents of specific ideologies. Finally, we consider the consequences of ideology, especially with respect to attitudes, evaluations, and processes of system justification.},

These issues come to the fore in the light of the intensive deployment of particular rhetorics of globalization and European integration within policy-making, journalistic and corporate communities. This paper seeks to contribute to the development of an institutionalist and yet social constructivist understanding of the appeal to external economic constraints (such as globalization and European integration) within contemporary European public policy and political economy. Through an attempt first to map the range of discourses of globalization and European integration in contemporary Europe and then to chart the (frequently) strategic deployment of such discourses in Britain, France, Germany and Italy, the paper attempts to move beyond an understanding of globalization discourse as the linguistic expression of exogenous interests.

The findings verify that the dominant type of Granger-causality is bidirectional. In instances that we found one-way causality, the pattern is not homogenous: Our analyses show that one-way causality generally runs from income to health in low- and middle-income countries whereas the reverse holds for high-income countries. Accordingly, care must be paid in defining the dependent and independent variables when specifying the determinants of health care expenditure.},

Attempts are being made, therefore, to funnel these resources away from nondemocratic governments and toward their citizens. Using formal analysis and building on existing theories of democratization, I analyze the effects of such institutional solutions when they function perfectly (the best-case scenario). The models show that even with institutional safeguards, these resources diminish chances for democratization. In addition to their practical importance, the results have an important theoretical implication: the political resource curse may not be due to dictators' use of these resources, but simply to their existence in nondemocracies.},

abstract = {Foreign direct investment (FDI) is an important element of the global economy and a central component of economic development strategies of both developed and developing countries. Numerous scholars theorize that the economic benefits of attracting multinational corporations come at tremendous political costs, arguing that democratic political systems attract lower levels of international investment than their authoritarian counterparts. Using both cross-sectional and time-series cross-sectional tests of the determinants of FDI for more than 100 countries, I generate results that are inconsistent with these dire predictions. Democratic political systems attract higher levels of FDI inflows both across countries and within countries over time. Democratic countries are predicted to attract as much as 70 percent more FDI than their authoritarian counterparts. In a final empirical test, I examine how democratic institutions affect country credibility by empirically analyzing the link between democracy and sovereign debt risk for about eighty countries from 1980 to 1998. These empirical tests challenge the conventional wisdom on the preferences of multinationals for authoritarian regimes.},

Public responsiveness to policy itself is as well. Only a small number of studies compare either policy or public responsiveness across political systems, however. Previous research has focused on a handful of countries {\textendash} mostly the US, UK and Canada {\textendash} that share similar cultures and electoral systems. It remains, then, for scholars to assess the opinion{\textendash}policy connection across a broad range of contexts. This paper takes a first step in this direction, drawing on data from two sources: (1) public preferences for spending from the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) and (2) measures of government spending from OECD spending datasets. These data permit a panel analysis of 17 countries. The article tests theories about the effects of federalism, executive{\textendash}legislative imbalance, and the proportionality of electoral systems. The results provide e...},

I attribute such nonfindings in part to carelessness regarding the inferential consequences of measurement error and in part to limitations of research design. In an analysis of opinion change during the 1980 presidential campaign, adjusting for measurement error produces several strong media exposure effects, especially for network television news. Adjusting for measurement error also makes preexisting opinions look much more stable, suggesting that the new information absorbed via media exposure must be about three times as distinctive as has generally been supposed in order to account for observed patterns of opinion change.},

Through analysis of Mexican public opinion data collected on the eve of that country's historic 2000 elections, we demonstrate that local context greatly affects evaluations of the legitimacy of the system, and these evaluations, in turn, help to shape the willingness of citizens to engage with the system. Citizens are more willing to participate in politics if they think the process is fair, and direct evidence of the fairness of the system is provided by the local political context. This local connection, then, becomes critical in the process of individuals becoming, in Almond and Verba's classic term, "participatory" citizens (1963).},

Attempts are being made, therefore, to funnel these resources away from nondemocratic governments and toward their citizens. Using formal analysis and building on existing theories of democratization, I analyze the effects of such institutional solutions when they function perfectly (the best-case scenario). The models show that even with institutional safeguards, these resources diminish chances for democratization. In addition to their practical importance, the results have an important theoretical implication: the political resource curse may not be due to dictators' use of these resources, but simply to their existence in nondemocracies.},

Building on theories from the political economy and comparative institutional literatures, we analyze the influence of an important aspect of globalization{\textemdash}the flow of immigration. Focusing on states in the European Union, we present a theoretical model that illustrates the interactive relationships between immigration, EU labor market integration, and domestic institutions. Our findings highlight how immigration in conjunction with domestic political institutions affects unemployment provisions, while labor market integrative forces remain in the background. The story of immigration and unemployment compensation in the EU is less about the opening of borders and the market forces of integration and more about the domestic political pressures.},

abstract = {International relations theorists tend to think in terms of continuous processes. Yet we observe only discrete events, such as wars or alliances, and summarize them in terms of the frequency of occurrence. As such, most empirical analyses in international relations are based on event count variables. Unfortunately, analysts have generally relied on statistical techniques that were designed for continuous data. This mismatch between theory and method has caused bias, inefficiency, and numerous inconsistencies in both theoretical arguments and empirical findings throughout the literature. This article develops a much more powerful approach to modeling and statistical analysis based explicitly on estimating continuous processes from observed event counts. To demonstrate this class of models, I present several new statistical techniques developed for and applied to different areas of international relations. These include the influence of international alliances on the outbreak of war, the contagious process of multilateral economic sanctions, and reciprocity in superpower conflict. I also show how one can extract considerably more information from existing data and relate substantive theory to empirical analyses more explicitly with this approach.},

Building on theories from the political economy and comparative institutional literatures, we analyze the influence of an important aspect of globalization{\textemdash}the flow of immigration. Focusing on states in the European Union, we present a theoretical model that illustrates the interactive relationships between immigration, EU labor market integration, and domestic institutions. Our findings highlight how immigration in conjunction with domestic political institutions affects unemployment provisions, while labor market integrative forces remain in the background. The story of immigration and unemployment compensation in the EU is less about the opening of borders and the market forces of integration and more about the domestic political pressures.},

Rather, they actively try to shape or manage citizens' perceptions of events (particularly those involving negative outcomes) through explanations or accounts. I argue that consideration of citizens' understandings of political accountability and how these are shaped by public officials represent critical missing components of models of electoral behavior. The distinction between excuses and justifications provides a valuable conceptual framework for understanding the impact of political accounts on a variety of judgments and psychological processes. I examine satisfaction with various excuses and justifications and their impact on subsequent evaluations of the official.},

author = {Dworkin, Andrea},
title = {{Talking to Men About Rape}},
journal = {Out!},
year = {1984},
volume = {2},
month = apr,
annote = {<b>then you had better understand that the root issue here has to do with male supremacy and the control of women; sexual access to women; women as reproductive slaves; private ownership of women. That is the program of the Right. That is the morality they talk about. That is what they mean. That is what they want. And the only opposition to them that matters is an opposition to men owning women. As a way of practicing equality, some vague idea about giving up power is useless. Some men have vague thoughts about a future in which men are going to give up power or an individual man is going to give up some kind of privilege that he has. That is not what equality means either. I want to see this men's movement make a commitment to ending rape because that is the only meaningful commitment to equality. It is astonishing that in all our worlds of feminism and antisexism we never talk seriously about ending rape. Ending it. Stopping it. No more. No more rape. In the back of our minds, are we holding on to its inevitability as the last preserve of the biological? Do we think that it is always going to exist no matter what we do? All of our political actions are lies if we don't make a commitment to ending the practice of rape. This commitment has to be political. It has to be serious. It has to be systematic. It has to be public. It can't be self-indulgent. Ending homophobia is worth doing. But you can't do it in a world with rape. else could you possibly be here to do? What else could this movement possibly mean? What else could matter so much? And on that day, that day of truce, that day when not one woman is raped, we will begin the real practice of equality, because we can't begin it before that day. Before that day it means nothing because it is nothing: it is not real; it is not true. But on that day it becomes real. And then, instead of rape we will for the first time in our lives--both men and women--begin to experience freedom.

We explore the attitudinal complexity of African-American support for Black Nationalism and discover two distinct dimensions of Black Nationalism, which we label community nationalism and separatist nationalism. While the former dimension enjoys support among several black subgroups, including more affluent blacks, the latter dimension is distinctly supported by blacks who are either younger, male, or less affluent. Furthermore, community and separatist nationalists generally agree upon a core set of nationalist tenets, although they diverge on the definition and breadth of the black struggle.},

The package implements a new expectation-maximization with bootstrapping algorithm that works faster, with larger numbers of variables, and is far easier to use, than various Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches, but gives essentially the same answers. The program also improves imputation models by allowing researchers to put Bayesian priors on individual cell values, thereby including a great deal of potentially valuable and extensive information. It also includes features to accurately impute cross-sectional datasets, individual time series, or sets of time series for different cross-sections. A full set of graphical diagnostics are also available. The program is easy to use, and the simplicity of the algorithm makes it far more robust; both a simple command line and extensive graphical user interface are included.},

The package implements a new expectation-maximization with bootstrapping algorithm that works faster, with larger numbers of variables, and is far easier to use, than various Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches, but gives essentially the same answers. The program also improves imputation models by allowing researchers to put Bayesian priors on individual cell values, thereby including a great deal of potentially valuable and extensive information. It also includes features to accurately impute cross-sectional datasets, individual time series, or sets of time series for different cross-sections. A full set of graphical diagnostics are also available. The program is easy to use, and the simplicity of the algorithm makes it far more robust; both a simple command line and extensive graphical user interface are included.},

title = {{Talking to Men About Rape}},
journal = {Out!},
year = {1984},
volume = {2},
month = apr,
annote = {<b>then you had better understand that the root issue here has to do with male supremacy and the control of women; sexual access to women; women as reproductive slaves; private ownership of women. That is the program of the Right. That is the morality they talk about. That is what they mean. That is what they want. And the only opposition to them that matters is an opposition to men owning women.

As a way of practicing equality, some vague idea about giving up power is useless. Some men have vague thoughts about a future in which men are going to give up power or an individual man is going to give up some kind of privilege that he has. That is not what equality means either.
I want to see this men's movement make a commitment to ending rape because that is the only meaningful commitment to equality. It is astonishing that in all our worlds of feminism and antisexism we never talk seriously about ending rape. Ending it. Stopping it. No more. No more rape. In the back of our minds, are we holding on to its inevitability as the last preserve of the biological? Do we think that it is always going to exist no matter what we do? All of our political actions are lies if we don't make a commitment to ending the practice of rape. This commitment has to be political. It has to be serious. It has to be systematic. It has to be public. It can't be self-indulgent.
Ending homophobia is worth doing. But you can't do it in a world with rape.

else could you possibly be here to do? What else could this movement possibly mean? What else could matter so much?
And on that day, that day of truce, that day when not one woman is raped, we will begin the real practice of equality, because we can't begin it before that day. Before that day it means nothing because it is nothing: it is not real; it is not true. But on that day it becomes real. And then, instead of rape we will for the first time in our lives--both men and women--begin to experience freedom.
If you have a conception of freedom that includes the existence of rape, you are wrong. You cannot change what you say you want to change. For myself, I want to experience just one day of real freedom before I die. I leave you here to do that for me and for the women whom you say you love.</b>},

annote = {<b>then you had better understand that the root issue here has to do with male supremacy and the control of women; sexual access to women; women as reproductive slaves; private ownership of women. That is the program of the Right. That is the morality they talk about. That is what they mean. That is what they want. And the only opposition to them that matters is an opposition to men owning women. As a way of practicing equality, some vague idea about giving up power is useless. Some men have vague thoughts about a future in which men are going to give up power or an individual man is going to give up some kind of privilege that he has. That is not what equality means either. I want to see this men's movement make a commitment to ending rape because that is the only meaningful commitment to equality. It is astonishing that in all our worlds of feminism and antisexism we never talk seriously about ending rape. Ending it. Stopping it. No more. No more rape. In the back of our minds, are we holding on to its inevitability as the last preserve of the biological? Do we think that it is always going to exist no matter what we do? All of our political actions are lies if we don't make a commitment to ending the practice of rape. This commitment has to be political. It has to be serious. It has to be systematic. It has to be public. It can't be self-indulgent. Ending homophobia is worth doing. But you can't do it in a world with rape. else could you possibly be here to do? What else could this movement possibly mean? What else could matter so much? And on that day, that day of truce, that day when not one woman is raped, we will begin the real practice of equality, because we can't begin it before that day. Before that day it means nothing because it is nothing: it is not real; it is not true. But on that day it becomes real. And then, instead of rape we will for the first time in our lives--both men and women--begin to experience freedom. If you have a conception of freedom that includes the existence of rape, you are wrong. You cannot change what you say you want to change. For myself, I want to experience just one day of real freedom before I die. I leave you here to do that for me and for the women whom you say you love.</b>},

How do political movements manifest new forums, promoting or resisting state power through social networking sites such as Facebook, Flickr, Twitter, or YouTube? How do states exert authority in the realm of digital activism? Unrest over official election results in Iran represents a case in which social media sites shape distinct sites wherein dissent is virtualized to challenge authoritarian rule, both offline and in cyberspace. Such cyberspaces of protest should be viewed in close connection with online governance through which the state can exert authority through surveillance operations, propaganda, and hacktivism. Online social media are agonistic arenas where information, ideas, values, and subjectivities are contested between (uneven) adversaries, and where new contexts could poten...},

abstract = {This article examines two emerging and related characteristics of digital networked-era journalism highlighted during the Egyptian revolution. First, the ability to retain centralized control of communication eroded both because contemporary networked communication thrives on increasing grassroots pervasiveness and because it retains a malleable or hackable quality, where users can rework the technology to their advantage with relative ease. Second, the influence of the networked decentralized reporting of the revolution on mainstream news outlets altered both the nature of the news products and the professional norms and practices of journalists. More precisely, the purpose or main task of the traditional news outlets shifted. In covering the story of the revolution, they turned{\textemdash} unabashedly, and to a significant degree{\textemdash}not to their own reporters to relay events on the ground, but to what networked participants in the drama were reporting and saying about what was happening. The mainstream outlets, in effect, were delivering a meta story about the story being reported by people hooked into digital social networks.},

First, the ability to retain centralized control of communication eroded both because contemporary networked communication thrives on increasing grassroots pervasiveness and because it retains a malleable or hackable quality, where users can rework the technology to their advantage with relative ease. Second, the influence of the networked decentralized reporting of the revolution on mainstream news outlets altered both the nature of the news products and the professional norms and practices of journalists. More precisely, the purpose or main task of the traditional news outlets shifted. In covering the story of the revolution, they turned{\textemdash} unabashedly, and to a significant degree{\textemdash}not to their own reporters to relay events on the ground, but to what networked participants in the drama were reporting and saying about what was happening. The mainstream outlets, in effect, were delivering a meta story about the story being reported by people hooked into digital social networks.},

abstract = {Does globalization affect perceptions of policy maker competence? Despite considerable attention to connections between globalization and policy efficacy, no research explores connections between the world economy and confidence in politicians. This article makes three novel arguments. First, by constraining administrative control over policy outcomes, economic globalization reduces levels of public confidence in national executives. Second, by signaling a more complex policy-making environment, exposure to world markets increases the volatility of policy maker evaluations. And third, economic openness affects public preferences over policy by shifting policy demands-away from domains constrained by market liberalization and toward areas where national autonomy remains strong. Time-series analyses of public opinion data from France support research expectations. As the first study to link economic globalization to policy perceptions, this article finds that the political consequences of engaging the global economy are more numerous than previously implied.},

abstract = {This article examines the causes for the rise of political scandals in Argentina in the early 1990s. Available explanations fail to provide a satisfactory answer, mainly because they ignore the interplay of forces that produce media revelations of government wrongdoing. Argentine scandals cannot be reduced to arguments about official corruption but rather require a consideration of political and media developments. Media expos{\'e}s in Argentina have resulted from particular political dynamics coupled with the increasing opposition of some news media to the Menem administration. Political dynamics such as democratic stability, a strong executive, and the weakness of political parties as policymaking and communication institutions have contributed to reinforcing the role of the press as an alternative arena for acting out political confrontations. The fact that two dailies have adopted a muckraking ethos and conducted investigative reporting, unusual for Argentine media standards, also accounts for the growing centrality of the press in mediating political battles.

abstract = {No other figure embodies revolutionary politics and radical chic quite like Ulrike Meinhof, who formed, with Andreas Baader and Gudrun Ensslin, the Red Army Faction (RAF), also known as the Baader{\textendash}Meinhof Gang, notorious for its bombings and kidnappings of the wealthy in the 1970s. But in the years leading up to her leap into the fray, Meinhof was known throughout Europe as a respected journalist, who informed and entertained her loyal readers with monthly magazine columns. What impels someone to abandon middle-class privilege for the sake of revolution? In the 1960s, Meinhof began to see the world in increasingly stark terms: the United States was emerging as an unstoppable superpower, massacring a tiny country overseas despite increasingly popular dissent at home; and Germany appeared to be run by former Nazis. Never before translated into English, Meinhof's writings show a woman increasingly engaged in the major political events and social currents of her time. In her introduction, Karin Bauer tells Meinhof's mesmerizing life story and her political coming-of-age; Nobel Prize{\textendash}winning author Elfriede Jelinek provides a thoughtful reflection on Meinhof's tragic failure to be heard; and Meinhof {\textquoteright}s daughter{\textemdash}a relentless critic of her mother and of the Left{\textemdash}contributes an afterword that shows how Meinhof's ghost still haunts us today.},

abstract = {This article examines the causes for the rise of political scandals in Argentina in the early 1990s. Available explanations fail to provide a satisfactory answer, mainly because they ignore the interplay of forces that produce media revelations of government wrongdoing. Argentine scandals cannot be reduced to arguments about official corruption but rather require a consideration of political and media developments. Media expos{\'e}s in Argentina have resulted from particular political dynamics coupled with the increasing opposition of some news media to the Menem administration. Political dynamics such as democratic stability, a strong executive, and the weakness of political parties as policymaking and communication institutions have contributed to reinforcing the role of the press as an alternative arena for acting out political confrontations. The fact that two dailies have adopted a muckraking ethos and conducted investigative reporting, unusual for Argentine media standards, also accounts for the growing centrality of the press in mediating political battles.

All forms of information technology were until recently either heavily regulated by the Tunisian state or were owned by individuals with close links to then-President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. This analysis looks at regulatory regimes across three media and communications technologies during the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia{\textemdash}Internet, television and mobile phones{\textemdash}and shows that the regulatory regimes of media and communications technologies co-evolved with the protests. As expression about public protests became increasingly pervasive within these media, efforts to control them became increasingly restrictive. Thus changes in the media and communications landscape are discussed in the context of the co-evolution of regulatory regimes.},

Results showed that The Times adhered to the paradigm by emphasizing the spectacle, quoting official sources, and de-valuing protesters as reporters maintained an impartial role. In contrast, Global Voices and Kristof{\textquoteright}s Twitter feed took different approaches, legitimizing protesters and serving as commentators/analysts, even actors, in the unfolding events. Global Voices also provided more opportunities for reader interactivity.},

I attribute such nonfindings in part to carelessness regarding the inferential consequences of measurement error and in part to limitations of research design. In an analysis of opinion change during the 1980 presidential campaign, adjusting for measurement error produces several strong media exposure effects, especially for network television news. Adjusting for measurement error also makes preexisting opinions look much more stable, suggesting that the new information absorbed via media exposure must be about three times as distinctive as has generally been supposed in order to account for observed patterns of opinion change.},

However, it happens at the most politically sensitive times and has widespread{\textemdash}if not global{\textemdash}consequences for political, economic and cultural life. When do states disconnect their digital networks, and why? To answer this question, the authors build an event history database of incidents in which a regime went beyond mere censorship of particular websites or users. The authors draw from multiple sources, including major news media, specialized news services, and international experts, to construct an event log database of 566 incidents. This rich, original dataset allows for a nuanced analysis of the conditions for state action, and the authors offer some assessment of the effect of such desperate action. Comparative analysis indicates that both democratic and authoritarian regimes disable social media networks for cit...},

This argument helps in understanding how cultural practices such as mass ceremonies constitute power, how talking in inward-facing circles helps coordination, and why `social' goods tend to be advertised on popular and expensive television shows. The main conclusion is that cultural practices, usually understood in terms of `meaning' or `content', must also be understood in terms of `publicity', or more precisely common knowledge generation.},

To examine this issue, we assess the direct effects of human rights upon FDI as well as the extent to which human rights indirectly affects FDI through its impact upon human capital. Using a system of simultaneous equations, we find respect for human rights to have a positive impact upon FDI.},

abstract = {Before there was money, there was debt Every economics textbook says the same thing: Money was invented to replace onerous and complicated barter systems{\textemdash}to relieve ancient people from having to haul their goods to market. The problem with this version of history? There{\textquoteright}s not a shred of evidence to support it. Here anthropologist David Graeber presents a stunning reversal of conventional wisdom. He shows that for more than 5,000 years, since the beginnings of the first agrarian empires, humans have used elaborate credit systems to buy and sell goods{\textemdash}that is, long before the invention of coins or cash. It is in this era, Graeber argues, that we also first encounter a society divided into debtors and creditors. Graeber shows that arguments about debt and debt forgiveness have been at the center of political debates from Italy to China, as well as sparking innumerable insurrections. He also brilliantly demonstrates that the language of the ancient works of law and religion (words like {\textquotedblleft}guilt,{\textquotedblright} {\textquotedblleft}sin,{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}redemption{\textquotedblright}) derive in large part from ancient debates about debt, and shape even our most basic ideas of right and wrong. We are still fighting these battles today without knowing it. Debt: The First 5,000 Years is a fascinating chronicle of this little known history{\textemdash}as well as how it has defined human history, and what it means for the credit crisis of the present day and the future of our economy.

abstract = {I address the functioning of the U.S. governing system by analyzing distributional outcomes from 1947 to 2000. The key question is whether public policy influences distributional outcomes. The macropolitics model and power resource theory suggest that left policies should equalize the distribution of income. I utilize single equation error correction models to assess the impact of policy on income inequality through two mechanisms-market conditioning and redistribution. Since nearly every government action influences markets in some way, I examine policy in the aggregate rather than focusing only on policies explicitly designed to redistribute income. The analysis indicates that policy influences inequality through both mechanisms, with left policy producing more equality. The results are consistent with power resource theory and strongly support the macropolitics model. Furthermore, I find that market conditioning is as important as, and works in tandem with, explicit redistribution.},

The model allows for nonstationary individual effects, and is estimated by applying instrumental variables to the quasi-differenced autoregressive equations. Particular attention is paid to specifying lag lengths, forming convenient test statistics, and testing for the presence of measurement error. The empirical results suggest the absence of lagged hours in the wage of forecasting equation. Our results also show that lagged hours is important in the hours equation, which is consistent with alternatives to the simple labor supply model that allow for costly hours adjustment or preferences that are not time separable.},

abstract = {Does globalization affect perceptions of policy maker competence? Despite considerable attention to connections between globalization and policy efficacy, no research explores connections between the world economy and confidence in politicians. This article makes three novel arguments. First, by constraining administrative control over policy outcomes, economic globalization reduces levels of public confidence in national executives. Second, by signaling a more complex policy-making environment, exposure to world markets increases the volatility of policy maker evaluations. And third, economic openness affects public preferences over policy by shifting policy demands-away from domains constrained by market liberalization and toward areas where national autonomy remains strong. Time-series analyses of public opinion data from France support research expectations. As the first study to link economic globalization to policy perceptions, this article finds that the political consequences of engaging the global economy are more numerous than previously implied.},

abstract = {Although the allure of consumption is the engine of globalization, political economists have tended to ignore varying consumer tastes as a potential source of beliefs about trade policy. This article develops a theory of trade policy preferences that adds the notion of varying consumer tastes to the standard labor-market application of the Heckscher-Ohlin trade model. The theory, which can explain trade preferences both across individuals and countries, is supported by an empirical analysis of survey data from 41 nations. Heavy consumers of exportables are found to be more protectionist than heavy consumers of imports and import-competing goods. Moreover, citizens in countries with expensive tradable goods see trade liberalization as a remedy to the rents they pay for protectionism. Other findings also support the more conventional labor-market side of the Heckscher-Ohlin model.},

abstract = {The Courage of the Truth is the last course that Michel Foucault delivered at the Coll{\`e}ge de France. Here, he continues the theme of the previous year's lectures in exploring the notion of {\textquotedblleft}truth-telling{\textquotedblright} in politics to establish a number of ethically irreducible conditions based on courage and conviction. His death, on June 25th, 1984, tempts us to detect the philosophical testament in these lectures, especially in view of the prominence they give to the themes of life and death.},

abstract = {The thesis that 'Capitalism does not just happen' is argued with reference to Gramsci, hegemony and the critique of state centrism. This involves a critique of the assumption that ruling classes rule effortlessly, and raises the issue: Does globalization increase the pressures on ruling classes to deliver? Global system theory is outlined in terms of transnational practices in the economic, political, and culture and ideology spheres and the characteristic institutional forms of these, the transnational corporation, transnational capitalist class and the culture-ideology of consumerism. The transnational capitalist class is organized in four overlapping fractions: TNC executives, globalizing bureaucrats, politicians and professionals, consumerist elites (merchants and media). Social movements for global capitalism and elite social movement organizations (ESMOs) are analysed. Each of the four fractions of the TCC has its own distinctive organizations, some of which take on social movement-like characteristics.},

In contrast, a political explanation of welfare state development in Chile and Mexico emphasizes the persistent differences in models of social provision. Mexico has used means-tested consumption subsidies and measures to correct market failures affecting the poor, while Chile used an asset redistribution and universal entitlement approach before 1973 and quasi-universal but modest consumption subsidies after 1990. Three political variables-competitiveness of the party system, organization of the poor, and alliance patterns-account for differences in welfare regime outcomes and are framed by the structural and ideational constraints of the prevailing developmental model.},

First, does democratization foster higher levels of trade and capital account openness? Second, do trade and capital account openness increase the likelihood of democratization? We review the literature in international political economy and comparative politics that has theoretically and empirically addressed these questions. We then conduct some empirical tests in a sample of developing countries to briefly evaluate the empirical relationship between democracy and economic globalization. Our analysis reveals that evidence for the claim that democracy fosters trade and capital account liberalization is robust but that empirical support for the predicted positive effect of economic openness on democracy among developing countries is weak. More theoretical work is needed to clarify the link between democracy and economic liberalization, and to this end we provide possible topics for future ...},

abstract = {Multilevel data are structures that consist of multiple units of analysis, one nested within the other. Such data are becoming quite common in political science and provide numerous opportunities for theory testing and development. Unfortunately, this type of data typically generates a number of statistical problems, of which clustering is particularly important. To exploit the opportunities offered by multilevel data, and to solve the statistical problems inherent in them, special statistical techniques are required. In this article, we focus on a technique that has become popular in educational statistics and sociology-multilevel analysis. In multilevel analysis, researchers build models that capture the layered structure of multilevel data, and determine how layers interact and impact a dependent variable of interest. Our objective in this article is to introduce the logic and statistical theory behind multilevel models, to illustrate how such models can be applied fruitfully in political science, and to call attention to some of the pitfalls in multilevel analysis.},

The study of riots has, however, probably focused too much on these {\textquotedblleft}push{\textquotedblright} factors that lead to violence and not enough on understanding the response of the state to riots. Understanding the political incentives that motivate democratic and authoritarian states to sometimes allow riots to take place and at other times to take the strongest possible law-and-order measures to prevent them is key to understanding variation in violence. Scholars also need to pay more attention to the psychological factors that encourage people to riot, and to the micro-logic of target choice within these larger events.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED:ROCR is a package for evaluating and visualizing the performance of scoring classifiers in the statistical language R. It features over 25 performance measures that can be freely combined to create two-dimensional performance curves. Standard methods for investigating trade-offs between specific performance measures are available within a uniform framework, including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) graphs, precision/recall plots, lift charts and cost curves. ROCR integrates tightly with R's powerful graphics capabilities, thus allowing for highly adjustable plots. Being equipped with only three commands and reasonable default values for optional parameters, ROCR combines flexibility with ease of usage.

AVAILABILITY:http://rocr.bioinf.mpi-sb.mpg.de. ROCR can be used under the terms of the GNU General Public License. Running within R, it is platform-independent.

Through analysis of Mexican public opinion data collected on the eve of that country's historic 2000 elections, we demonstrate that local context greatly affects evaluations of the legitimacy of the system, and these evaluations, in turn, help to shape the willingness of citizens to engage with the system. Citizens are more willing to participate in politics if they think the process is fair, and direct evidence of the fairness of the system is provided by the local political context. This local connection, then, becomes critical in the process of individuals becoming, in Almond and Verba's classic term, "participatory" citizens (1963).},
